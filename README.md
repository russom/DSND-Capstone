## Overview
This Project is submitted as part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.


## Requirements
In order to facilitate the execution of it  I have prepared an [`environment.yml`](./environment.yml) file to be used to install an environment with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/):

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

After the installation the environment should be visible via `conda info --envs`:

```sh
# conda environments:
#
dsnd-capstone        /usr/local/anaconda3/envs/dsnd-proj5
...

```

Further documentation on working with Anaconda environments can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).
